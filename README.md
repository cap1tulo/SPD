Software Design Patterns course. 


# **WEEK4. Creational Design Patterns.**

Patterns: "**Singleton**":"**Prototype**":"**Builder**":"**Factory Method**":"**Abstract Factory**".
~~~
**Singleton** - creating single-instance classes, thread-safe, and lazy initialization implementations.

**Prototype** - cloning objects to avoid overhead.

**Builder** - construction of complex objects step-by-step.

**Factory Method** - dynamic object creation for increased flexibility.

**Abstract Factory** - managing multiple factories with seamless abstraction.
